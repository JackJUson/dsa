Question 6

Which of the data structures is most suitable? Justify your answer.
You must use time complexities as a basis for your justification.


Hash tables do not maintain the order of items, which would make it
difficult to implement Pop and PrintInOrder efficiently, so we can dismiss
it immediately.

Ordered linked lists and ordered arrays incur an O(n) cost for Push due
to needing to find the correct position to insert (in the case of linked
lists) or to shift items (in the case of arrays). The remaining data
structures can perform Push more efficiently, so we can dismiss these.

For an AVL tree that is ordered by priority:
- Push is O(log n), as we simply insert into the AVL tree
- Pop is O(log n), as we simply delete the highest priority item from the
  AVL tree
- PrintInOrder is O(n), as we simply perform a reverse in-order traversal

For a heap:
- Push is O(log n)
- Pop is O(log n)
- However, a heap does not store a global ordering of items, only a
  heap ordering where each item is greater than its children. To implement
  PrintInOrder we must pop all the items and print each item as it is
  removed. This is O(n log n). We then need to re-insert all the items,
  as PrintInOrder is not supposed to modify the heap, which is O(n log n).

Thus the most suitable data structure is an AVL tree.
